poki pona
=========
> good box

This is a tiny little terminal emulator based on VTE and GTK-3. It doesn't do
much, and is specifically set up for my own needs and nothing else. It's a
full-screen terminal with the color scheme I prefer, and a few custom key
bindings, and no window decorations. This is all it does.

## Building

```
$ meson b && cd $_
$ ninja
$ ./poki-pona
```
